# Channel-Flow

## Launcher

To start the code place you in the Channel-Flow directory and run the commande **./laucher.sh**

This will start a user interface. You can now change the model, the splited number of time and the number of considered plans.
Click on: __Apply__ to apply the new parameters. 
You can display the parameters by cliking on: __Show Parameters__

If you need to change other parameter you will have to go in the subdirectory _parameters_ where you can find three C program each coresponding to a model. There you can change any parameter you want. Don't forget to save the C file and click on __Apply__ in the UI again to save your changes.

Click on: __Run__ to start the code.
For the moment the code is unstopable. That mean that when you start it either you wait or it to endd or you can CTR+C or close the UI to end it manualy. 
For a next upddate I would like to add a stop button to stop it manualy without closing the UI window.

If you don't want to use the UI window just run the code with: **./run.sh** when you are in the Channe-flow directory.
